/**
 * This package contains the repository interfaces used for data persistence and
 * retrieval.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Repositories in this package are used to abstract the data access layer,
 * providing a clean and consistent interface for interacting with the
 * underlying database. The repositories leverage Spring Data JPA to simplify
 * the implementation of common persistence operations, such as CRUD operations
 * and custom queries.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each repository interface extends
 * {@link org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository} or other Spring
 * Data repository interfaces, allowing for seamless integration with the Spring
 * framework's repository infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some common features of the repositories in this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>CRUD operations for various domain entities.</li>
 * <li>Custom query methods using Spring Data JPA's query derivation
 * mechanism.</li>
 * <li>Optional support for pagination and sorting.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Repositories in this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.encryption.repo.AuditRepo} - Used to persist and retrieve
 * audit data from Data base</li>
 * <li>{@link com.encryption.repo.UserDetailsRepo} - Used to persist and
 * retrieve user data from Data base</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage of repositories in this package allows for separation of concerns
 * between the business logic and the data access logic, making the code more
 * maintainable and testable.
 * </p>
